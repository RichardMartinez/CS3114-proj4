 * Project 4 Seminar Memory Manager
 * 
 * Compiled using JRE 11 for CS 3114
 * Operating System: Windows 11
 * IDE: Eclipse
 * Date Completed: 05-04-2024
 * Created By: Richard Martinez
 * 
 * In this project, I implemented a seminar database
 * using a memory manager and a hash table. The memory
 * manager uses the buddy system which allows for splitting
 * and merging of memory blocks but can result in internal
 * fragmentation. The closed hash table implements the double
 * hashing technique which minimizes clustering. Both data
 * structure automatically resize when necessary to meet project
 * requirements.
